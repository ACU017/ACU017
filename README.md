## A bit more about my Skills 

My main stack is (M)ERN, the M is a work in progress as I am doing the certification from MongoDB university in Spanish. My library consists of mostly fullstack apps I developed during the bootcamp. 

Front-end : I used React and really enjoyed playing with libraries like Bootstrap, Tailwind and my beloved Bulma. Like most developers I struggle centering a <div>, however my background in applied arts helps me design despite an opinionated CSS. 

My passion for communication and knowledge of invisible disability has led me to be a very acute UX designer. I am able to identify and provide solutions to make a website and processes more accessible. 

Back-end: We used node.js and express among other tools like JWT and bcrypt to protect passwords and make authentication-authorization. My comfort lies in vanilla Javascript and using Express to connect endpoints. I struggled my way to make an admin restricted area in the mentor matcher, nevertheless I made it successfully (in only 1 week).
